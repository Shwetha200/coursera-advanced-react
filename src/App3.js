//TASK 3
// In this exercise, you'll create a light-dark theme switcher.

// The starter code includes all the necessary UI elements, as well as a Switch component to toggle the theme. Your goal is to implement the missing functionality inside ThemeContext.js. ThemeContext already exports a ThemeProvider component and a useTheme hook. At the moment, they don't do anything and return dummy values.

// Code displat for theme provider and theme name
// You'll need to implement both the ThemeProvider component and the useTheme hook inside the ThemeContext.js file to complete this exercise.

// ThemeProvider should render a context provider component and inject as the context value an object with two properties: a theme property that is a string, that can be either light or dark, and a function named toggleTheme that enables you to toggle the theme. The useTheme hook should return that context object.

// Note: Before you begin, make sure you understand how to work with the Coursera Code Lab for the 
// Advanced React course
// .

// If you run npm start and view the app in the browser, you'll notice that the starting React app works as is. The app outputs a simple view with a header, page and a switch widget in the top right corner to change the theme.

// Steps
// Step 1
// Open the ThemeContext.js file.

// Create a ThemeContext object using React.createContext().

// Implement the ThemeProvider component. It should accept a children prop and return a ThemeContext.Provider component. The ThemeContext.Provider receives an object as its value prop, with a theme string and a toggleTheme function.

// toggleTheme should toggle the theme between light and dark.

// Step 2
// Implement the useTheme hook. It should return the theme and toggleTheme values from the ThemeContext.

// Step 3
// Open the Switch/index.js file. Add an onChange prop to the input element and pass a callback function, as the event handler, to change the theme. You don‚Äôt need to use the event argument in this case.

// Step 4
// Verify that the app works as expected. You should be able to toggle the theme between light and dark. Notice how the background color of the page changes, as well as the color of the text.

        make me stop trying all of the others.
